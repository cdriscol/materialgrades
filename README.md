# Chris Driscol - Material Grades
Playing around with [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) and [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

## How do I run this thing?
Fair question..

### Run it from GitHub Pages
Open [this URL](https://cdriscol.github.io/materialgrades) in your browser.

### Run it locally
Rolling up your sleeves, I can respect that!

I'll assume you know how to use [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) if you've made it this far.

*Install npm dependencies*
```bash
$ npm install
```

*Install bower dependencies*
```bash
$ bower install
```

*Compile assets*
```bash
$ gulp build
```

Open **index.html** in a browser of your choice.
